About me

I’m Nixon, an aspiring software engineer based in the GTA/Waterloo area, with a deep passion for creating innovative, critical, high-quality, and user-centric software solutions!

I’m currently in my 3B term, studying Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo.

Outside of school and work, I enjoy my leisure time watching technical YouTube videos, learning more about various topics and fields. When I’m not learning, I like to go to the gym and compete in powerlifting competitons!

If you’re interested in connecting with me, feel free to reach out through LinkedIn or email!
